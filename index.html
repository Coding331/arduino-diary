    <h1>Arduino Diary</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is a diary for my one hundred hour training course for Electronics,
        every day will be a page full of everything new i had learned.
    </p>

    <h2>Pre-Training</h2>
    <p>Before starting this training program I had joined a winter camp dedicated
        to teaching the basics of Electronics and Arduino, but before that I had no experience
        whatsoever of neither Electronics nor Arduino.
    </p>

    <h2>This Program</h2>
    <p>This program is training for a competition that will be about Electronics, I need at least one hundred hours
        worth of training to be elligble to compete in the competition.</p>

    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>This day was spent in learning the basics of the Serial Monitor and Variables</p>
